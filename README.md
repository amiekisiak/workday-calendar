# workday-planner


## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app is running in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app:

* Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner,
 
* Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down,
 
*  Each timeblock is color-coded based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed,
 
* Allows user to enter an event when they click a timeblock,

* Saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock,

* Events persist between refreshes of a page.

There is also a button included to clear content of the text area and local storage.
